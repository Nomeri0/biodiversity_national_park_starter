# Biodiversity in National Parks - Data Analysis Project

## Project Overview

This project aims to analyze species data from various national parks in the U.S., with a focus on endangered species and their conservation statuses. Using data from the National Parks Service, the goal is to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA), identify patterns, and uncover insights regarding biodiversity and species conservation.

## Project Objectives

- Explore species data from national parks.
- Analyze the conservation statuses of species and investigate patterns or themes.
- Visualize biodiversity in parks and examine the relationship between species and conservation status.
- Summarize findings and offer insights based on the analysis.

## Dataset

Two datasets are used in this project:

1. Species Information (species_info.csv): Contains details on species' scientific and common names, categories (e.g., Mammal, Bird), and their conservation status.

2. Park Observations (observations.csv): Contains the number of observations of each species across different national parks.

## Key Steps

1. Data Exploration:

- Loaded and inspected both datasets for basic structure and summary statistics.
- Handled missing values, particularly in the conservation_status column, where many species were found to lack a status.

## Species and Conservation Status Analysis:

- Investigated the distribution of species by category (e.g., Mammals, Birds) and their conservation statuses (e.g., Endangered, Threatened).
- Visualized the number of species per category to gain insights into biodiversity.

## Visualization:

- Created visualizations to illustrate species diversity and highlight any trends.

## Conclusion

We observed a significant variety of species across different national parks. The analysis uncovered that many species in the dataset did not have a specified conservation status. We explored the number of species per category and identified which categories might require further attention for conservation.

This project serves as a foundational analysis and practice for more in-depth future work on biodiversity and conservation in national parks.

## Future Steps

- Further analysis on the relationship between species conservation status and national parks.
- Use more advanced visualization techniques to illustrate trends and insights.
- Clean and refine the data for better accuracy.
